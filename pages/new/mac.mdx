# New ParaMind Brainstorming Software for Mac OSX -- Creative Writing Software for Mac OSX

## Finally -- Brainstorming Software for Mac OSX!




We have just released our first ParaMind for Mac OSX.


ParaMind Brainstorming Software for Mac OSX is the first creativity package for Mac OSX that works with words. ParaMind Brainstorming Software for Mac OSX offers you an instant way to generate new ideas for great brainstorming and problem-solving sessions.

Other types of creative thinking or brainstorming software often require a steep learning curve, ask the user endless questions, or are merely sophisticated flow charts, ParaMind for Mac OSX gives the user back brainstorms after typing in any sentence and making a few key clicks.

The ParaMind brainstorming program for Mac OSX was built on the new idea of brainstorming by getting every idea that can be expressed in language by "meaningfully exhausting the interactions of words" in any given subject area.

ParaMind Brainstorming Software for Mac OSX is the result of long investigation into how to create ideas by computer-human interaction, and ideas in its theory can be shown going back hundreds of years in philosophy. The largest problem encountered and overcome in the ParaMind program is how to get the computer to understand the complexity of word relationships. ParaMind copies the user's sentence hundreds or thousands of times and replaces selected words with related "Word Categories." The results can be humorous or even breathtaking.

ParaMind for Mac OSX Version 1.0 comes with 650 general Word categories. There are over 1100 Word Categories that the user can buy, and they can add in as many as they want. The new ParaMind for Mac OSX has automated features previously only found in the ParaMind Professional version. These features make ParaMind a more automatic brainstorming program, like the old proverbial computers from old science fiction magazines. When you select "Automatic," ParaMind will automatically find Word Categories that contain your selected word and will then give you the option of brainstorming on them.

The price of ParaMind for Mac OSX is now only $49.95.
