# New ParaMind Upgrades

Anyone who uses ParaMind 3.0 and greater (including ParaMind Lite 3.0) can now greatly improve their brainstorming experience with these products. Scientists working in advanced fields can get fresh new insight on any idea because our products are totally configurable. Anything -- words, symbols, or phrases -- can be typed on the ParaMind screen. Also, the user can create their own "segments of thought" (we call these "Word Categories") to use again and again in their brainstorming sessions. We have taken the work out of this by creating over 1100 Word Categories to brainstorm with using your own sentences, but you can create as many of your own Word Categories as you want.
These new "segments of thought" or Word Category add-on packs allow your program to operate more efficiently by automating the brainstorming process. Where competing products charge as much as $300 for different versions, ParaMind offers you their add-ons for $19.95 each. You will benefit from these cost-effective solutions that will enhance the product. These enhancements fit needs for solving difficult problem from business to scientific brainstorming.
