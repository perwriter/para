# New Scientific Brainstorming Software for Inventors or Anyone -- Windows, Mac and Linux

We have just released the world's first scientific brainstorming software program in the form of our Scientific Word Category database. This scientific version comes in the form of a 100 Word Category database that any user of ParaMind 3.0 or above can use. Each one of the 100 Word Categories contains up to twenty-two words of scientific terminology.

The program replaces words in the user's sentence, which contains his or her idea or problem, with the new word categories making totally unique and interesting new combinations.

Anyone who uses ParaMind 3.0 and greater (including ParaMind Lite 3.0) can now greatly improve their brainstorming experience with these products. Scientists working in advanced fields can get fresh new insight on any idea because our products are totally configurable. Anything -- word, symbol, or phrase -- can be typed on the ParaMind screen. Also, the user can create their own "segments of thought" (we call these "Word Categories") to use again and again in their brainstorming sessions. We have taken the work out of this by creating over 1100 Word Categories to use to brainstorm with your sentences. This makes ParaMind totally configurable.

These new "segments of thought" or Word Category add-on packs allow your program to operate more efficiently by automating the brainstorming process. Where competing products charge as much as $300 for different versions, ParaMind offers you their add-ons for $19.95 each.

Here is a list of the Word Categories in our new Scientific Database Number One. Each one of these contains to 22 words each. See below for some examples.
