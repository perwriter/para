# ParaMind Brainstorming Software -- Idea Creation Technology
# ParaMind Brainstorming Software Professional -- Top of the Line Brainstorming

We are happy to introduce you to our new top-of-the-line version of the ParaMind Brainstorming program. The idea-generating power is now totally automated to allow you to create instant ideas from your sentences by pressing one button. You create many more ideas by creating much larger "merges" of ideas.

A maximum of twenty-five Word Categories can be now be selected for a Large Simple or Complex Merge compared to only two in the earlier versions. The ParaMind Professional Version allows multiple windows to be open at a time, creating a separate window for each merge and displaying the results of the merge in a new window. The number of Word Categories you can have in a single directory has been expanded to 1250 in the Professional version.

What we did with the ParaMind program was to imitate what an intelligent thinker does when they consider every option to a problem. Their mind goes through many possibilities while a less intelligent thinker can only think of a few. There have been no other brainstorming programs that can give relevant feedback on your sentence in thousands of combinations of ideas like ParaMind can.

Note: if you are interested in the fullest brainstorming software available, consider purchasing the Scientific version database and the Business/Law version database. The Professional Version does not include these additional Word Categories.
