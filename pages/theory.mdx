# Meaningful Word-Interaction Exhaustion -- ParaMind's Operating Theory
Unlike many brainstorming programs, the learning curve is extremely easy with ParaMind. We spent much time and effort getting features like the "program wizard" into our product so the program would be very easy to use. Now with the new ParaMind Professional Version, all one has to do is type or paste in their sentence and press one button to get results.

So one doesn't need to know a lot of theory to use our program. There is a fascinating theory behind the ParaMind program, however. It states simply that the solution to many of our problems can be expressed in language and therefore these solutions can be found by intelligently manipulating language. If we use language in a new way, we can come up with these solutions that have eluded us in our old ways of using language.
