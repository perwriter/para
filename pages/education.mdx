# ParaMind: A Truly Fun Way to Learn Grammar!
Click here to read more about using ParaMind for students of English as a second language (ESL).

To use ParaMind with children takes only moderate computer skills. ParaMind comes with a large manual with many examples to make using ParaMind easily understandable.

ParaMind Brainstorming Software helps students have fun when learning English. Using ParaMind with teacher supervision can help students learn the difference between parts of speech such as adjectives, nouns, verbs, past-tense verbs, adverbs and others. The ParaMind Word Categories are all organized in groups of nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, etc. The students will see these groupings of words together under parts of speech, and understand while creating fun and sometimes hilarious brainstorming results.

ParaMind is built on solid language theory. No other brainstorming, idea creation, flow chart or "mind" type program is based on better language science. Using ParaMind in the class room can teach young students about grammar concepts while helping them develop their own ideas. ParaMind "brainstorm" with these related word chains by inserting them into your students sentences. The student picks from a list of five-hundred related word chains called "Word Categories." When the student is done picking the Word Categories, the program automatically interchanges these words into the student's own sentence. The program replaces and merges them for up to a hundred pages of new ideas that are all related to the student's original sentence.

Students will see their sentence expanded with adverbs or adjectives, nouns, prepositions or conjunctions. They will clearly see exactly what an adjective or adverb is when they use it. For instance, if they pick an adjective category to replace a noun in their sentence, they will see how this does not sound right. Other grammar lessons can be taught by examining ParaMind outputs.

There is nothing offensive or of an adult nature in the ParaMind Word Category database. Most of the words in the database are words a student is expected to know by the time they graduate high school.
